## 📊 Target Brazil E-Commerce Data Analysis (SQL Project)

### ⭐ Situation

Target is a global retail company and wants to understand how e-commerce is growing in Brazil. The company has a large dataset that includes customer details, order information, payment data, product prices, freight charges, and delivery timelines. The data is stored in multiple tables, which makes it difficult to understand customer behavior directly. To support better business decisions, Target needed a clear and structured data analysis to understand ordering trends, customer distribution, payment behavior, and delivery performance across different states in Brazil.

### 🎯 Task

My role as a Data Analyst was to explore and analyze this dataset using SQL. The main task was to study how customers place orders, when they place orders, where they are located, how much they spend, and how fast orders are delivered. I also needed to analyze payment methods and installment patterns. The final goal was to extract meaningful insights from raw data and convert them into information that can help the business improve logistics, pricing, and customer experience.

### ⚙️ Action

I started by performing basic exploratory data analysis to understand the structure of the dataset. I checked the data types of all columns in the customers table and identified the time range during which orders were placed. After that, I calculated the number of unique cities and states where customers placed orders. To understand growth, I analyzed order trends over different years and months and checked whether there was a clear increase in orders over time. I also grouped orders by different time slots such as dawn, morning, afternoon, and night to understand when Brazilian customers mostly place orders.

Next, I analyzed the evolution of e-commerce across Brazil by calculating month-on-month orders for each state and studying how customers are distributed across states. To understand economic impact, I analyzed total and average order prices and freight costs at the state level. I also calculated the percentage increase in order value from 2017 to 2018 for the same months to measure growth. For delivery performance, I measured the number of days taken to deliver each order and compared actual delivery dates with estimated delivery dates. Finally, I analyzed payment behavior by studying payment types and installment usage over time. All analysis was done using SQL features such as joins, CTEs, date functions, and aggregate functions.

### 📈 Result

The analysis showed a clear growth in e-commerce orders over the years, which indicates increasing customer trust in online shopping. Most customers placed orders during morning and afternoon hours, showing strong daytime buying behavior. Customer distribution and order volume varied significantly across states, highlighting regional differences in demand. Some states had higher freight costs and longer delivery times, which points to possible logistics inefficiencies. The comparison between estimated and actual delivery dates helped identify states with faster-than-expected delivery performance. Payment analysis revealed that digital payment methods and installment-based payments were very popular among Brazilian customers.

### 🏁 Conclusion

This project helped convert complex e-commerce data into clear business insights using SQL. The results can help Target improve delivery planning, reduce freight costs, optimize payment options, and enhance customer satisfaction. From a personal learning perspective, this project strengthened my SQL skills, improved my analytical thinking, and gave me real-world experience in solving business problems using data. It also helped me understand how data analysis supports decision-making in large retail organizations.
